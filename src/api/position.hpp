/*
 * The API used to transfer cone data between
 * microservices in this project.
 * 
 * The API includes:
 * - cone_t:       a struct for holding positional
 *                 information of cones
 * 
 * - timestamp_t:  a struct representing a UNIX
 *                 timestamp, consisting of the 
 *                 seconds passed since epoch and
 *                 the amount of mictoseconds since
 *                 the last full second
 * 
 * - data_t:       a struct representing the full
 *                 package that is written to the
 *                 shared memory. It contains four
 *                 (4) cones and two (2) timestamps
 * 
 * - APIException: a collection of enumerations that
 *                 represent exceptions related to
 *                 the API
 * 
 * - create:       a function that initiates the API
 * 
 * - attach:       a function that attaches to an
 *                 existing API
 * 
 * - clear:        a function that cleans up the API
 * 
 * - put:          puts data into the shared memory
 * 
 * - get:          reads data from the shared memory
